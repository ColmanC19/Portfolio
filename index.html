        <h2>Get to know a little about me</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of fun, adventures, experiences, my girlfriend Anna and my dog Bailey. I currently am the Manager of Valet Services at a Marriott Hotel in downtown Portland. I'm excited to bring my experience of problem solving, service to others, teamwork and critical thinking to my continued growth here at Epicodus. My hobbies include:</p>

        <h2>Here are some projects I've worked on so far here at Epicodus:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/ColmanC19/coffee-blog.git">Here's a page I made about my love for coffee.</a></li>
          <p>For this I built upon what I had previously learned and incorperated <span class="codes">divs, spans, a tags, and columns</span>.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/ColmanC19/Bailey.git">Here's a page I made about my dog, Bailey.</a></li>
          <p>I made this as an homage to my wonderful dog, <strong>Bailey</strong>. I made it outside of class to further strengthen my knowledge of <span class="codes">divs, spans, classes and anchors</span>. I did much of the same work on this one, but added a README to it as well. </p>
