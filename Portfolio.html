I'm excited to bring my experience of problem solving, service to others, teamwork and critical thinking to my continued growth here at Epicodus. My hobbies include:</h5>

              <li><a href="https://github.com/ColmanC19/coffee-blog.git">Here's a page I made about my love for coffee.</a></li>
                <h5>For this I built upon what I had previously learned and incorperated <span class="codes">divs</span>, <span class="codes">spans</span>, <span class="codes">a tags</span> <span class="codes">and columns</span>.</h5>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ColmanC19/Bailey.git">Here's a page I made about my dog, Bailey.</a></li>
                <h5>I made this as an homage to my wonderful dog, Bailey. I made it outside of class to further strengthen my knowledge of divs, spans, classes and anchors. I did much of the same work on this one, but added a README to it as well. </h5>
